  //    sign-in call does not reliably throw the same collision error an
  //    OAuth attempt does — so this is checked proactively, before a link is
  //    ever sent, rather than relied on as a catch afterward.
  //  - handleAccountExistsWithDifferentCredential() is the load-bearing
  //    guard for the reverse direction ("already has an email-link account,
  //    tries Google") — auth/account-exists-with-different-credential is a
  //    well-documented, reliable error from signInWithPopup/signInWithRedirect
  //    in that case. It's also wired into the email-link completion path
